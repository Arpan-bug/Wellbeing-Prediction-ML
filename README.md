Wellbeing Prediction Using Machine Learning
📌 Overview
This project predicts work-life balance scores using Lasso Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. The analysis incorporates feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and interpretability techniques such as SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) to understand feature importance.
📊 Key Findings
•	Daily stress has the most negative impact on work-life balance.
•	Supporting others & strong social connections significantly improve overall wellbeing.
•	Feature selection improved model efficiency without significant performance loss.
•	SHAP & LIME were used to provide interpretability and model explainability.
🔧 Tech Stack
•	Programming Language: Python
•	Libraries: Scikit-Learn, SHAP, LIME, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
•	Machine Learning Models: Lasso Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
